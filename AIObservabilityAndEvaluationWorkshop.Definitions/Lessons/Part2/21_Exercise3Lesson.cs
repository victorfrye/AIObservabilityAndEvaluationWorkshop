         *     - Fails messages that contain profanity
         *     - Scores messages based on how "enthusiastic" they are (presence of exclamation points, all-caps words, emojis, etc.)
         *     - Fails messages that have words longer than seven letters long in them
         *
         * Alternatively:
         * - Expand your previous evaluation to include content safety evaluators such as HateAndUnfairnessEvaluator and SelfHarmEvaluator. (Requires Microsoft Foundry and Identity auth)
